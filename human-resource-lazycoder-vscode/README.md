## Introduction

Welcome to **Human Resource Machine LazyCoder**, the ultimate VS Code extension for coding in Human Resource Machine's LazyCoder language. If youâ€™re tired of mundane coding chores, this extension has your backâ€”well, at least when it comes to syntax highlighting! ðŸŒŸ

For now, it does one thing and does it well: making your LazyCoder code look good. A full-fledged language server is in the works, so stay tuned! ðŸš€

## Features

This extension provides syntax highlighting for HRML, making it easier to write, read, and understand HRML scripts directly in VSCode. Key features include:
- Highlighting for keywords, function names, and comments.
- Support for single-line comments and specialized keywords like `sub` and `function`.
- Distinctive coloration for control structures, numeric literals, and function definitions.

Example of syntax highlighting in action:

> Tip: Consider adding an animation to demonstrate real-time syntax checking or auto-completion features in future versions!
