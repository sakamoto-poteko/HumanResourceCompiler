Designing an effective data structure for your Intermediate Representation (IR) is crucial for implementing compiler optimizations and transformations like Control Flow Graph (CFG) construction and Static Single Assignment (SSA) form. A well-structured IR should allow you to easily group instructions by functions, manage basic blocks within those functions, and facilitate further analyses and transformations.

### Recommended Hierarchical Data Structure

A **hierarchical, modular structure** is generally the most effective way to organize your IR. This structure typically follows these layers:

1. **Program / Module**
2. **Functions**
3. **Basic Blocks**
4. **Instructions**

Here’s how you can structure each layer:

#### 1. Program / Module
- **Description:** The top-level container that holds all the functions, global variables, and other module-level constructs.
- **Components:**
  - **List of Functions:** Each function encapsulates its own CFG and set of basic blocks.
  - **Global Variables:** Definitions and declarations accessible across functions.
  
#### 2. Function
- **Description:** Represents a single function in the program.
- **Components:**
  - **Function Metadata:** Name, return type, parameters, etc.
  - **Control Flow Graph (CFG):** Represents the flow of control within the function.
  - **List of Basic Blocks:** Each function contains multiple basic blocks that make up its CFG.
  
#### 3. Basic Block
- **Description:** A sequence of instructions with a single entry point and a single exit point.
- **Components:**
  - **Basic Block ID / Label:** Unique identifier for the block (e.g., `B1`, `B2`).
  - **List of Instructions:** The actual TAC instructions within the block.
  - **Successors:** Pointers or references to successor basic blocks (for CFG edges).
  - **Predecessors:** Pointers or references to predecessor basic blocks (useful for SSA).
  
#### 4. Instruction
- **Description:** A single TAC instruction.
- **Components:**
  - **Opcode:** The operation to perform (e.g., `ADD`, `SUB`, `JMP`).
  - **Operands:** The operands involved in the operation.
  - **Metadata:** Any additional information (e.g., line numbers, debug info).

```
Program

├── Function A
│   ├── Basic Block A1
│   │   ├── Instruction 1
│   │   ├── Instruction 2
│   │   └── Instruction 3
│   ├── Basic Block A2
│   │   ├── Instruction 4
│   │   └── Instruction 5
│   └── CFG for Function A
│       ├── A1 → A2
│       └── A2 → A1
│
├── Function B
│   ├── Basic Block B1
│   │   ├── Instruction 1
│   │   └── Instruction 2
│   └── CFG for Function B
│       └── B1 → B1
│
└── Global Variables
    ├── Var1
    └── Var2
```

### Implementation Considerations

#### 1. **Modularity**
- **Functions as First-Class Entities:** Each function should be a self-contained unit with its own CFG and basic blocks. This encapsulation makes it easier to perform function-specific optimizations and analyses.
  
#### 2. **CFG Representation**
- **Graph-Based Structure:** Use adjacency lists or adjacency matrices to represent the CFG within each function. Typically, adjacency lists are more memory-efficient.
- **Node Representation:** Each node in the CFG corresponds to a basic block. Use pointers or references to link basic blocks.
  
#### 3. **Basic Block Identification**
- **Unique Labels:** Assign unique labels or IDs to each basic block for easy reference and manipulation.
- **Linking Predecessors and Successors:** Maintain both predecessor and successor lists to facilitate SSA construction and dominance analysis.

#### 4. **Instruction Storage**
- **Sequential Containers:** Use dynamic arrays (e.g., `std::vector` in C++) or linked lists to store instructions within a basic block.
- **Efficient Access:** Ensure that instructions can be accessed and modified efficiently, which is essential for optimizations and transformations.

### Example Data Structures in Pseudocode

Here’s a simplified example using object-oriented pseudocode:

```pseudo
class Program {
    List<Function> functions
    List<GlobalVariable> globalVariables
}

class Function {
    string name
    List<BasicBlock> basicBlocks
    ControlFlowGraph cfg
    // Additional metadata
}

class BasicBlock {
    string label
    List<Instruction> instructions
    List<BasicBlock> successors
    List<BasicBlock> predecessors
}

class Instruction {
    Opcode opcode
    List<Operand> operands
    // Additional metadata
}

enum Opcode {
    ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, JMP, CJMP, etc.
}

class Operand {
    // Define operands (variables, constants, etc.)
}
```

### Handling Basic Blocks and Functions

To address your specific concern:

- **Grouping by Functions with Basic Blocks:** Each `Function` contains a list of `BasicBlock` objects. This way, you can easily group instructions within their respective functions while also organizing them into basic blocks.
  
- **Marking Functions and Basic Blocks:**
  - **Functions:** Have unique identifiers (names) within the `Program` class.
  - **Basic Blocks:** Have unique labels or IDs within each `Function` to identify entry points, loop headers, etc.

### Access Patterns

- **Iterating Over Functions:** Iterate through the `functions` list in the `Program` to process each function.
- **Iterating Over Basic Blocks:** Within each `Function`, iterate through the `basicBlocks` list to process or transform each basic block.
- **Iterating Over Instructions:** Within each `BasicBlock`, iterate through the `instructions` list to manipulate or analyze individual instructions.

### Additional Enhancements

#### 1. **Symbol Tables**
- **Per Function:** Maintain symbol tables within each `Function` to manage variable scopes and bindings.
  
#### 2. **Dominance Information**
- **For SSA:** Precompute dominance and dominance frontiers for each `Function`’s CFG to facilitate SSA construction.

#### 3. **Metadata Storage**
- **Debugging and Optimization:** Store additional metadata such as source code line numbers, variable usage counts, or optimization flags within the relevant classes.

### Example Workflow Using the Data Structure

1. **Parsing and TAC Generation:**
   - Convert AST to TAC, grouping instructions under their respective functions.
   
2. **Building CFG:**
   - For each `Function`, identify basic blocks and establish CFG edges by populating the `successors` and `predecessors` lists in each `BasicBlock`.
   
3. **SSA Transformation:**
   - Within each `Function`, compute dominance frontiers using the CFG.
   - Insert ϕ-functions in the appropriate `BasicBlock` objects.
   - Rename variables by traversing the CFG in dominance order and updating `Instruction` objects accordingly.

### Leveraging Existing Frameworks

If you prefer not to build everything from scratch, consider leveraging existing compiler frameworks that provide robust IR representations:

- **LLVM:** Offers a rich IR (LLVM IR) with built-in support for CFGs and SSA. It’s highly optimized and widely used in the industry.
- **MLIR:** A flexible intermediate representation framework part of the LLVM project, designed to support multiple levels of abstraction.
- **libFirm:** Provides SSA-based IR with support for various compiler optimizations.

These frameworks can save you significant development time and offer extensive documentation and community support.

### Summary

To effectively store your IR with support for functions and basic blocks:

- **Adopt a Hierarchical Structure:** Organize your IR into a hierarchy of Program → Functions → Basic Blocks → Instructions.
- **Use Graph Structures for CFGs:** Represent CFGs within each `Function` using adjacency lists or similar graph-based structures.
- **Maintain Clear Identifiers:** Ensure that each `Function` and `BasicBlock` has unique identifiers for easy reference and manipulation.
- **Facilitate SSA Construction:** Structure your IR to support dominance analysis and easy insertion of ϕ-functions.

This approach provides the flexibility and organization needed to implement CFG construction and SSA form efficiently, while maintaining clarity and modularity in your compiler’s IR.
