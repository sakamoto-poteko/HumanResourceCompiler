# Human Resource Machine LazyCoder Language Support README

This is the README for your extension "Human Resource Machine LazyCoder Language Support". This extension provides specialized syntax highlighting and editing support for the Human Resource Machine LazyCoder Language (HRL), enhancing the coding experience for developers using this novel language.

## Features

This extension provides syntax highlighting for HRL, making it easier to write, read, and understand HRL scripts directly in VSCode. Key features include:
- Highlighting for keywords, function names, and comments.
- Support for single-line comments and specialized keywords like `sub` and `function`.
- Distinctive coloration for control structures, numeric literals, and function definitions.
